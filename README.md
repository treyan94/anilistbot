# anilistbot
An unofficail telegram bot for [anilist.co](https://anilist.co/) that searches for anime and anime characters. I wrote this when I was learning Go and GraphQL.

# Usage
The bot requires a telegram api key, which you can get from the BotFather. All the required info can be found at https://core.telegram.org/bots. Once you've got the key, you either create an env varibale name `ANI_BOT_KEY`, or you can pass it as the first argument. The second option takes precedence.
